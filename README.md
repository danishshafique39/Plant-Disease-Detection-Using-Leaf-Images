# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Leaf-Images
This project is a web-based application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the PlantVillage dataset. The model is deployed using Flask and offers an interactive user interface for image upload and prediction.
 Project Overview

- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Dataset:** [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (via Flask templates)
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Libraries Used:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Flask

## Features

- Upload a leaf image via web interface
- Real-time prediction of plant disease
- Displays confidence level of the prediction
- User-friendly interface
- Handles common preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization)
